# Foil

The [`Foil`](@ref) is a minimalistic version of the [`Trainer`](@ref) that allows to make only minimal changes to your Flux code while still obtaining many of the benefits of Tsunami. This is similar to what `Lighting Fabric` is to `PyTorch Lightning`. `Foil` also resembles HuggingFace's `accelerate` library.
